# Todo:
- [ ] speed not working properly.
- [ ] check why it does not use the ui_functions module (branching issues?)
- [ ] fix shadow  (act like the shadow of the premiere?)

- [x] speed: don't change the frame rates, but the number of frames.
- [x] seems as the compression of premiere is twice as small as the same changes with this program - why? (maybe its the frame rate or the bitrate)
- [x] make bitrate an option
- [x] BUG when changing the numbers - the sliders don't change the same.
- [x] BUG: changing the sliders does not directly change the view.
- [ ] Why the speed of premiere is much higher ? (can we optimize?)
