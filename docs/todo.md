- [x] speed: don't change the frame rates, but the number of frames.
- [x] seems as the compression of premiere is twice as small as the same changes with this program - why? (maybe its the frame rate or the bitrate)
- [ ] make bitrate an option
- [ ] think of 'seconds' and not percentage.
- [ ] BUG when changing the numbers - the sliders dont chaneg the same.
- [ ] BUG: changing the sliders does not directly change the view.
- [ ] Why the speed of premiere is much higher ? (can we optimize?)
