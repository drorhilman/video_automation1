# Todo:

- speed: dont change the frame rates, but the number of frames.
- seems as the compression of premiere is twice as small as the same chanegs with this progrma - why? (maybe its the fram rate or the bitrate)
- make bitrate an option
- think of 'seconds' and not percentage. 
- BUG when changing the numbers - the sliders dont chaneg the same.
- BUG: changing the sliders does not directly change the view. 
- Why the speed of premiere is much higher ? (can we optimize?)
